## From Carpenter to Conduit — J.C.

I started learning code at 38 while still swinging a hammer every day.  
For five years my wife and I lived on almost nothing so I could build full-time.  
No investors. No salary. Just a feeling that something much bigger was moving through me.  

I share initials with the most famous carpenter who ever lived.  
Five years ago I put down the hammer and started hammering code instead.  

This is what came through.

If any of this is useful to you, and you’re able to help keep the lights on and the sawdust flying, my family and I would be eternally grateful.

SOL: `BvX4D5qKmNWj9noGRaNcwZ7YEvjFc8ekpcTMMRqQcwf`

Every satoshi, wei, or lamport is another day I get to keep building the free future.  
Thank you for helping me finish the job.

## Core Pillars

| Pillar      | Technology                          | Meaning |
|------------|-------------------------------------|---------|
| Identity   | Solavia + WebCrypto                 | You own your private keys forever |
| Storage    | Helia (IPFS) + IndexedDB            | Public = immutable IPFS · Private = encrypted local |
| Compute    | ELOS-DEEP recursive engine          | Millions of ops/sec inside the browser |
| Intelligence | Ollama-ready bridge + local inference | Run real LLMs inside -I-AM-OS- (coming v3.1) |
| Runtime    | ENOS Capsule System                  | Deploy AI agents as versioned CIDs |

---

## Features (v3 – “Sentinel”)

- Complete desktop environment in a single tab  
- Dual-mode file manager (IPFS public ↔ IndexedDB private)  
- **ELOS-DEEP**: the most powerful vanity address / pattern hunter ever built in a browser  
- **ENOS Capsule Engine** – create, run, branch, and distribute AI-powered services via CID  
- Built-in code editor with instant execution  
- Terminal with real commands (`ls`, `ipfs`, `identity`, `chain`, etc.)  
- Encrypted P2P-ready messaging  
- Decentralized social feed (publish once → immutable forever)  
- Floating AI assistant (Ollama bridge ready)  
- Media dock – embed YouTube, Twitch, images, videos  
- Particle ambient background + full dark cyber aesthetic

---

## Tech Stack (100% client-side)

- Helia v4 (full IPFS node in the browser)  
- Solavia identity layer (post-quantum ready)  
- ELOS-DEEP recursive compute engine  
- ENOS capsule runtime with sandboxing & AI inference  
- IndexedDB + Web Crypto API  
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS – no build step, no npm, no backend

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ELOS-MAX/i-am-os.git
cd i-am-os
open index.html

That’s it. You now have a sovereign OS running locally.

ENOS Capsules – The Future of Browser Apps

Capsules are self-contained, versionable, executable services stored on IPFS:

// In browser console → instant AI service
await ENOSDemo.runAllDemos()

	•	Embed tiny ML models
	•	Pulse-based execution engine
	•	Full sandbox + permission manifest
	•	Branch & version like git, but on IPFS

⸻

ELOS-DEEP – Extreme Browser Compute

Find Ethereum vanity addresses at insane speed:
	•	Up to 15 million+ addresses/second (on high-end hardware)
	•	Configurable recursion depth, branching, pulse rate
	•	Real-time dashboard + match highlighting

Use responsibly – this will max your CPU.

Roadmap

Version	Milestone
v3.0	Sentinel (current) – single-file sovereign OS
v3.1	Ollama native integration (run Llama 3, Mistral, etc. locally)
v3.5	WebRTC mesh sync between -I-AM-OS- instances
v4.0	Full PWA + installable desktop app
v5.0	-I-AM-CHAIN- – on-device private blockchain

I-AM-OS eliminates both.
