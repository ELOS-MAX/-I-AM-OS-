## Core Pillars

| Pillar        | Technology                          | Meaning |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|---------|
| Identity      | Solavia + WebCrypto                 | You own your private keys forever |
| Storage       | Helia (IPFS) + IndexedDB            | Public = immutable IPFS · Private = encrypted local |
| Compute       | ELOS-DEEP recursive engine          | Millions of ops/sec inside the browser |
| Intelligence  | Ollama-ready bridge + local inference | Run real LLMs inside I-AM-OS (v3.1) |
| Runtime       | ENOS Capsule System                 | Deploy AI agents as versioned CIDs |

---

## Features (v3 – “Sentinel”)

- Full desktop environment in a single tab  
- Dual-mode file manager (IPFS public ↔ IndexedDB private)  
- **ELOS-DEEP**: extreme browser compute, pattern/vanity hunter  
- **ENOS Capsule Engine**: create, run, branch, distribute AI-powered services  
- Built-in code editor with instant execution  
- Terminal (`ls`, `ipfs`, `identity`, `chain`, etc.)  
- Encrypted P2P-ready messaging  
- Decentralized social feed (publish once → immutable forever)  
- Floating AI assistant (Ollama bridge ready)  
- Media dock (YouTube, Twitch, images, video)  
- Particle ambient background + dark cyber aesthetic

---

## Tech Stack (100% client-side)

- Helia v4 (full IPFS node in the browser)  
- Solavia identity layer (post-quantum ready)  
- ELOS-DEEP recursive compute engine  
- ENOS capsule runtime with sandboxing & AI inference  
- IndexedDB + Web Crypto API  
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS — no build step, no npm, no backend

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ELOS-MAX/i-am-os.git
cd i-am-os
open index.html
```
Now you have a fully sovereign OS running locally.

⸻

ENOS Capsules – Browser Apps
	•	Self-contained, versioned, executable services on IPFS
	•	Embed tiny ML models
	•	Pulse-based execution engine
	•	Full sandbox + permission manifest
	•	Branch & version like git, but decentralized

// In browser console
await ENOSDemo.runAllDemos()


⸻

ELOS-DEEP – Extreme Browser Compute
	•	Up to 15M+ addresses/sec (high-end hardware)
	•	Configurable recursion depth, branching, pulse rate
	•	Real-time dashboard + match highlighting

Use responsibly — this will max your CPU.
