### Core Pillars

| Pillar       | Technology                          | Meaning |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|--------|
| Identity     | Solavia + WebCrypto                 | You own your private keys forever |
| Storage      | Helia (IPFS) + IndexedDB            | Public = immutable IPFS · Private = encrypted local |
| Compute      | ELOS-DEEP recursive engine          | Millions of ops/sec inside the browser |
| Intelligence | Ollama-ready bridge + local inference | Run real LLMs inside -I-AM-OS- (coming v3.1) |
| Runtime      | ENOS Capsule System                 | Deploy AI agents as versioned CIDs |

### Features (v3 – “Sentinel”)

- Complete desktop environment in a single tab  
- Dual-mode file manager (IPFS public ↔ IndexedDB private)  
- ELOS-DEEP: the most powerful vanity address / pattern hunter ever built in a browser  
- ENOS Capsule Engine – create, run, branch, and distribute AI-powered services via CID  
- Built-in code editor with instant execution  
- Terminal with real commands (`ls`, `ipfs`, `identity`, `chain`, etc.)  
- Encrypted P2P-ready messaging  
- Decentralized social feed (publish once → immutable forever)  
- Floating AI assistant (Ollama bridge ready)  
- Media dock – embed YouTube, Twitch, images, videos  
- Particle ambient background + full dark cyber aesthetic  

### Tech Stack (100% client-side)

- Helia v4 (full IPFS node in the browser)  
- Solavia identity layer (post-quantum ready)  
- ELOS-DEEP recursive compute engine  
- ENOS capsule runtime with sandboxing & AI inference  
- IndexedDB + Web Crypto API  
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS – no build step, no npm, no backend  

### Quick Start

```bash
# Literally just:
git clone https://github.com/ELOS-MAX/i-am-os.git
cd i-am-os
open index.html
```

That’s it. You now have a sovereign OS running locally.

### ENOS Capsules – The Future of Browser Apps

Capsules are self-contained, versionable, executable services stored on IPFS:

```js
// In browser console → instant AI service
await ENOSDemo.runAllDemos()
```

- Embed tiny ML models  
- Pulse-based execution engine  
- Full sandbox + permission manifest  
- Branch & version like git, but on IPFS  

### ELOS-DEEP – Extreme Browser Compute

Find Ethereum vanity addresses at insane speed:

- Up to **15 million+ addresses/second** (on high-end hardware)  
- Configurable recursion depth, branching, pulse rate  
- Real-time dashboard + match highlighting  

> Use responsibly – this will max your CPU.

### Roadmap

| Version | Milestone |
|-------|----------|
| v3.0  | Sentinel (current) – single-file sovereign OS |
| v3.1  | Ollama native integration (run Llama 3, Mistral, etc. locally) |
| v3.5  | WebRTC mesh sync between -I-AM-OS- instances |
| v4.0  | Full PWA + installable desktop app |
| v5.0  | -I-AM-CHAIN- – on-device private blockchain |

### You Are the OS

> “There is no cloud. There is only other people’s computers.”  
> -I-AM-OS- eliminates both.
